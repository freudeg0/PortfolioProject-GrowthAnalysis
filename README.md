## Insights
**1.The adoption of E-Stamps challans experienced a notable surge in 2020, but has since plateaued in 2021, likely due to market saturation and user resistance stemming from technological unfamiliarity and inconvenience.**

**2.There has been a discernible upward trajectory in Stamp Duty revenue since 2019, which can be attributed to a surge in property transactions and a thriving real estate market.**

**3.These sectors which have made significant investments in Telangana can be attributed to the favorable business environment created by TS-iPASS and the incentives offered to these sectors under the Industrial Policies.**

**4. Despite the upward trend in investments since 2019, theemployment trajectory has consistently declined, possibly due to businesses adopting automation and technology to reduce labor costs.As industries advance technologically,there may be a shortage of skilled workers to operate and maintain these systems.**

**5. The demand for new vehicles has decreased while the demand for used vehicles has increased since 2019 (excluding incomplete 2023 data). This trend may be due to rising vehicle prices, making used vehicles more affordable. Additionally,limited government financing and leasing programs may contribute to this.**

## Recommendations
**1.Establish dedicated helplines staffed with trained operators capable of providing guidance to individuals navigating the e-stamp online fee payment process via telephone, in order to surmount the growth plateau.**

**2.Consider investing in affordable housing projects with a portion of increased stamp duty revenue.
Also,consider implementing progressive stamp duty rates that increase with property values. This generates higher revenue from luxury transactions while keeping the tax burden lower for lower-income buyers.**

**3.Formulate a comprehensive infrastructure development plan to capitalize on the substantial investments made by various sectors. Refine inducements offered to industries to maximize investment returns with minimal incentives.**

**4.Allocate resources towards training and reskilling initiatives to facilitate the transition of displaced workers, caused by skill mismatch, into growing industries. Implement social welfare policies to aid local communities affected by this displacement.**

**5.Offering incentives for electric or hybrid vehicles can influence new vehicle preferences.Introduce financing and leasing programs for new vehicles.Unattractive financing terms may prompt consumers to explore used vehicles.**
